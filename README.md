## Description
This is an advanced application based on the official Angular documentation, organized into modules, that illustrates how to use Angular routing with route parameters, child routes, routes guard and lazy loading.

## Installation
If you're using OS X or Windows, use one of the installers from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Be sure to install the version labeled LTS. Other versions have not yet been tested with npm.

Then, you can install the Angular CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
